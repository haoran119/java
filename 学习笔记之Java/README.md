# 学习笔记之Java

* [Java (programming language) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))
* Java is a general-purpose computer-programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented,[15] and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[17] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. As of 2016, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use,[18][19][20][21] particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[22] Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its original features from SmallTalk, with a syntax similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-levelfacilities than either of them.
* The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License. Others have also developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries), and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for applets).
* The latest version is Java 11, released on September 25, 2018. Java 11 is a currently supported long-term support (LTS) version ("Oracle Customers will receive Oracle Premier Support"); Oracle released for the "legacy" Java 8 LTS the last "public update", which is free for commercial use, in January 2019. Oracle will still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use up to at least December 2020. Oracle (and others) "highly recommend that you uninstall older versions of Java",[23] because of serious risks due to unresolved security issues.[24][25][26] Since Java 9 is no longer supported, Oracle advises its users to "immediately transition" to Java 11. Oracle extended support for Java 6 ended in December 2018.[27]

* How to convert double to long ?
  * [How to Convert a Double to Long in Java - Example Tutorial | Java67]
    * Double.longValue()
    * casting a double to long
    * if you need rounding you can use Math.round() method to round a floating point number into nearest integral number
  ```java
  public class DoubleToLong {


      public static void main(String args[]){

          // first example - converting double to long using longValue() method
          double d = 102.9520;
          long l = (new Double(d)).longValue();
          System.out.println("double value=" + d + ", long=" + l);

          // second example - rather simple just cast double to long
          double bill = 293.05;
          long myBill = (long) bill;
          System.out.println("double value=" + bill + ", long=" + myBill);


          // third example - rounding double value to long in Java
          double dbl = 3421.56;
          long rnd = Math.round(dbl);
          System.out.println("double value=" + dbl + ", long=" + rnd);

      }

  }

  Output
  double value=102.952, long=102
  double value=293.05, long=293
  double value=3421.56, long=3422

  * [The List Interface (The Java™ Tutorials > Collections > Interfaces) (oracle.com)
    * A List is an ordered Collection (sometimes called a sequence). Lists may contain duplicate elements. In addition to the operations inherited from Collection, the List interface includes operations for the following:
      * Positional access — manipulates elements based on their numerical position in the list. This includes methods such as get, set, add, addAll, and remove.
      * Search — searches for a specified object in the list and returns its numerical position. Search methods include indexOf and lastIndexOf.
      * Iteration — extends Iterator semantics to take advantage of the list's sequential nature. The listIterator methods provide this behavior.
      * Range-view — The sublist method performs arbitrary range operations on the list.

    * public Field[] getFields() throws SecurityException
    * Returns an array containing Field objects reflecting all the accessible public fields of the class or interface represented by this Class object.
    * If this Class object represents a class or interface with no accessible public fields, then this method returns an array of length 0.
    * If this Class object represents a class, then this method returns the public fields of the class and of all its superclasses and superinterfaces.
    * If this Class object represents an interface, then this method returns the fields of the interface and of all its superinterfaces.
    * If this Class object represents an array type, a primitive type, or void, then this method returns an array of length 0.
    * The elements in the returned array are not sorted and are not in any particular order.
    * Returns:

  * [Class (Java SE 10 & JDK 10 ) (oracle.com)
    * public Field[] getDeclaredFields() throws SecurityException
    * Returns an array of Field objects reflecting all the fields declared by the class or interface represented by this Class object. This includes public, protected, default (package) access, and private fields, but excludes inherited fields.
    * If this Class object represents a class or interface with no declared fields, then this method returns an array of length 0.
    * If this Class object represents an array type, a primitive type, or void, then this method returns an array of length 0.

    * This method may be used by a caller in class C to enable access to a member of declaring class D if any of the following hold:
      * C and D are in the same module.
      * The member is public and D is public in a package that the module containing Dexports to at least the module containing C.
      * The member is protectedstatic, D is public in a package that the module containing D exports to at least the module containing C, and C is a subclass of D.
      * D is in a package that the module containing Dopens to at least the module containing C. All packages in unnamed and open modules are open to all modules and so this method always succeeds when D is in an unnamed or open module.
    * This method cannot be used to enable access to private members, members with default (package) access, protected instance members, or protected constructors when the declaring class is in a different module to the caller and the package containing the declaring class is not open to the caller's module.
